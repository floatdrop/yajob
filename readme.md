# yajob [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/floatdrop/yajob.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/floatdrop/yajob)

Job queue on MongoDB. It uses atomic writes to grab jobs and exposes generator friendly API.

__Requirements__:

 * NodeJS `>= 4`
 * MongoDB `>= 2.6`

## Usage

```js
const yajob = require('yajob');
const mails = yajob('localhost/queuedb')
    .tag('mails');

mails.put({
    from: 'floatdrop@gmail.com',
    to: 'nodejs-dev@dev-null.com',
    body: 'Wow!'
});
// => Promise

for (var mail of yield mails.take(100)) {
    yield sendmail(mail);
}
```

Processed jobs removed from queue, when for-loop is ended or broken (either with `break` or exception).

### Updating pending events with metadata

You may also attach metadata to future job and update as follows:

```js
const yajob = require('yajob');
const mails = yajob('localhost/queuedb')
    .tag('mails');

var d = new Date();
d.setHours(24,0,0,0);

mails.put({
    from: 'floatdrop@gmail.com',
    to: 'nodejs-dev@dev-null.com'
}, {
    meta: {body: 'You have 1 new notification'},
    schedule: d
});
// => Promise

// Meanwhile, a new notification comes in

mails.replace({
    from: 'floatdrop@gmail.com',
    to: 'nodejs-dev@dev-null.com'
}, {
    meta: {body: 'You have 2 new notification'},
    schedule: d
});

// Now, when you take the job in the future:

let job = yield mails.take();
console.log(job);
```

This would print out:
```
{
    from: 'floatdrop@gmail.com',
    to: 'nodejs-dev@dev-null.com',
    body: 'You have 2 new notification'
}
```

This will only send out a single email with the new body.

### Skip jobs

In some cases you will need to skip taken job. To do this pass into generator `false` value:

```js
const jobs = yield mails.take(100);
const job = jobs.next().value;

if (value === 'Ohnoez') {
    job.next(false); // Returns Ohnoez back to queue and get next job
}
```

### Priorities

By default, all jobs have priority `0`. You can specify `sort` for queue, in which jobs will be taken:

```js
const important = queue.tag('mail').sort({priority: -1});
```

## API

### Yajob(uri, [options])

Returns instance of queue, that stores data in MongoDB.

##### uri
Type: `String`

MongoDB URI string.

##### options
Type: `Object`

MongoDB [MongoClient.connect options](http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/2.1/api/MongoClient.html).


## Methods

### put(attrs, [options])

Add job to queue. Returns `Promise`.

##### attrs
Type: `Object` / `Array`

Data, that will be attached to job. If `attrs` is an `Array` - then every `Object` in `attrs` considered as new job.

##### options
Type: `Object`

 * `schedule` - `Date`, when job should be available to `take`
 * `priority` - `Number`, that represents priority of job
 * `meta` - `Object`, optional metadata attached to job and returned in taken object

### replace(attrs, [options])

Update a pending job in the queue. Returns `Promise`.

##### attrs
Type: `Object`

Data, that will be attached to job.

##### options
Type: `Object`

 * `schedule` - `Date`, when job should be available to `take`
 * `priority` - `Number`, that represents priority of job
 * `meta` - `Object`, optional metadata attached to job and returned in taken object

### take([count])

Returns `Promise` that resolves to a `Generator`, that will emit jobs one by one.

After all jobs are taken from batch - they are considered `done` and removed from queue.

##### count
Type: `Number`
Default: `1`

Maximum number of jobs to take from one batch request.

### remove(attrs)

Removes jobs, that match `attrs` from queue. Returns `Promise`.

### close([force])

Closes connections to MongoDB.

## Setters

### tag(name)
Default: `default`

Sets `name` of the MongoDB collection, that will be used to save and get jobs.

### delay(milliseconds)

Sets delay for job, that is not scheduled. That is - every job without `schedule` options will be scheduled on `Date() + delay`.
If job is failed delay will be used to define new shedule on `Date() + delay`.

### trys(number)
Default: `Infinity`

Sets maximum job trys, before `failed` status will be assigned.
Delay between trys is set by `delay(milliseconds)` method.

### sort(order)

Sets sort order rule for `take`. Use this, when you need to get jobs, [sorted by priority](#priorities).

### Job status

* `0` - __new__ job, that was just added to queue
* `1` - __taken__ job, that was assigned to `takenBy` worker
* `2` - __failed__ job, that has more `attemts` than allowed
